# Heat Seal Tags

Heat seal tags are tags that are intended to be retained on the garment across multiple cleaning sessions. This allows information about the specific garment to be tracked

## Adding tags while adding items to invoices

A heat seal tag can be added right from the add/change invoice page by typing into the heat seal tag text box and hitting enter or scanning a barcode while in the text box

Coupon codes allow a group of discounts to be linked to a code that can be sent by email and redeemed in store. The setup is in the [Managers section of Setup](../Setup/Manager/Coupon-Codes.md).

Once a code is setup it can be redeemed by entering the code into the coupon code text box in the promotions section:

![Coupon Codes Entry](../../.attachments/Documentation/CouponCodes-Entry.png "Coupon Codes Entry")

If a bad code is entered it will display an error message.

![Bad Code](../../.attachments/Documentation/CouponCodes-BadCode.png "Bad Code")

If the customer has already used the code then a different message will be shown

![Already Used](../../.attachments/Documentation/CouponCodes-AlreadyUsed.png "Already Used")

Once the code is entered it will cycle through the list of discounts and allow the employee to select an item fore each one.

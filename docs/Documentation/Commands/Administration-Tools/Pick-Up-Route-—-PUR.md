# Pick Up Route — PUR

Usually items on a route would be marked picked up after they are unloaded from the Metal Progetti machine using the [MU](/Documentation/Commands/Multiple-Pickup-—-MU.md) command but if there is an issue with the machine the entire route may miss the marking. In this case this command is used to mark all items on a route as picked up within a date range.

After selecting the route and date range the `Load` button will load a list of un picked up items on the route.

These items can be selected and marked picked up. When a single item is selected the `Go To Invoice` button can be used to jump the to the invoice in question for a more detailed analysis.

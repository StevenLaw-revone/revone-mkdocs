When cashing in the drawer total will be calculated automatically.

When cashing out the invoices since the last cash in will be shown and the difference will be calculated. Important to note is that the invoices will be from the last cash in if there is no intervening cash out so if there is a missing cash in and out then it can include multiple days.

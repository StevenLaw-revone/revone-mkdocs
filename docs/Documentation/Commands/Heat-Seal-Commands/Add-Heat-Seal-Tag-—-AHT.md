# Add Heat Seal Tag â€” AHT

Adds a heat seal tag to the current customer. This allows the tag number, brand, item, color, upcharge, defects, measurements, and a note to be associated with the tag. The only required items are the tag number, brand, and item

The brand will attempt to find an existing brand to prevent multiple brands with the same name as well as attempt to prevent multiple slightly differently spelled versions of a single brand

If there is a defect on the item that can be tracked here. This allows a pre existing defect to be recorded as existing before the item is worked on

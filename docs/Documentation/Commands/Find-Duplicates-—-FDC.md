# Find Duplicates â€” FDC

Finds duplicate customer records and opens the ability to join them to similarly named customers. This uses a fuzzy compare function that generates a similarity rating and compares it to a threshold. This is to allow customers with spelling errors and typos to be compared.

The find function requires a button press so that the threshold and years since last in can be set before undertaking the rather lengthy comparison process

On deactivation a popup will display the number of customers deactivated and the number who were skipped due to open invoices (invoices that haven't been marked paid and picked up or removed). It will ask if you want a CSV file of deactivated customers and if you accept it will open a dialog to ask where to save the file. If there are customers that couldn't be closed it will save a CSV file for those customers
